CSCE 4901 Capstone Project Repository

  The End Stage Renal Disease Network of North Texas wishes to provide better education 
and accessibility for their treatment options to their patients. Most hospitals and dialysis 
centers rarely give enough information for people to understand their options and patients have 
very little knowledge of how their kidneys even work. This application will help in that aspect 
as well as giving patients the resources to find nearby clinics and setting up appointments for 
their respective treatments.
