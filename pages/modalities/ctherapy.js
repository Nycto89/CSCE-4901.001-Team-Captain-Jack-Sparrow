                  The option of choosing not to perform
                  dialysis is entirely up to you. There may be times when dialysis isn’t
                  the right choice for someone with kidney disease. If you decide not to
                  perform dialysis, you may opt for conservative therapy or conservative
                  care. This process involves your doctors keeping you comfortable for
                  the remainder of your life, which includes providing relief from the
                  discomfort and pain from kidney failure. However, choosing conservative
                  therapy is an important decision that should be discussed between you,
          your doctor and your loved ones. {'\n'} People who choose conservative
                  therapy can live between a few months or sometimes more than a year.
                  The time frame differs depending on your medical conditions, how much
                  kidney function remains and your diet and amount of fluids.  However,
          without dialysis, a person with ESRD will die a natural death. {'\n'}
                  If you decide on this option, talk to your doctor about ways to reduce
                  pain and symptoms of kidney failure such as swelling or shortness of
                  breath. You may also discuss options such as palliative care or hospice
          care to enhance comfort for the remainder of your life.</Text>
